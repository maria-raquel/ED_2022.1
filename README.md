This is a personal repository for practicing and studying for my Data Structures class, taught by professor Liliane dos Santos Machado, in 2022.

In here, I've implemented some data structures, some activities suggested by the professor, and some exercises from the book Introdução a Estruturas de Dados (Celes, Cerqueira, Rangel).
